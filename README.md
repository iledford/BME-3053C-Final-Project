# BME-3053C-Final-Project
'This project will be able to detect COVID-19 in the lungs of a patient through a CT scan of the lungs using a created MATLAB program. Lungs will appear opaque on a CT image, for which we will create a program to detect how opaque the lungs are and if it reaches a certain degree, it can be classified as infected with COVID-19. The aims of this project are to create a MATLAB program that can successfully analyze a lung CT scan as well as compare healthy lungs to lungs infected with COVID-19.'
